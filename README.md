Project Icarus dares to retell a legend — not as a tragedy, but as a triumph. In myth, Icarus soared on handcrafted wings, rising higher and higher until he fell. But what if he didn’t fall because he flew too high… but because he flew without direction? Today, we bring that story full circle. Born from the ground up with a custom-built drone, a Teensy-powered brain, precision sensors, and high-thrust motors, Project Icarus isn't just a flying machine — it's a leap toward solving one of the most critical challenges in aerial robotics: autonomous navigation that’s smart, adaptive, and reliable. It’s modular, manufacturable, and built for real-world chaos — not just labs and test fields. This isn’t just about flight anymore. It’s about purpose, precision, and rewriting the rules of how machines move through the skies. Because this time, Icarus doesn't crash — he calculates. And he lands exactly where he means to.
