<h1 align="center">Project Icarus</h1>

<p align = 'justify'>
In Greek mythology, Icarus flew too close to the sun — not out of foolishness, but out of ambition. While his wings melted, his daring spirit became a symbol of human aspiration and the unrelenting desire to break free of earthly bounds.
<br>
Project Icarus Prime embraces that same spirit — but with the wisdom of engineering, the discipline of code, and the fire of innovation. Born from a blank circuit board and a vision of flight, this drone is not just a machine; it’s a manifestation of calculated ambition.
<br>
Powered by a Teensy brain, sensing its world with gyroscopes and barometers, and roaring to life through GEPRC 4500kW motors, this drone is crafted to be more than a prototype. It’s a modular, rapidly manufacturable aerial platform, ready to adapt, evolve, and serve a spectrum of missions — from precision delivery to environmental sensing and beyond.
